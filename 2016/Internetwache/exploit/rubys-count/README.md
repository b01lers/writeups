# Internetwache : Ruby's Count

#### Author: yfb76

We needed to submit a sequence of 10 characters matching /^[a-f]${10}/ the sum of whose ASCII value needed to be greater than 10\*ord(f) ('f' has the greatest ascii value of the chars listed).  Some googling reveals that ^ and $ are buggy in ruby regexes: they just match newlines.  So, send 'ggggggggg\n' + 'f'\*10 + '\n'.  Hooray Flag!
